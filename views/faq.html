        <font face="courier" color="ffff00">1. What is this thing?</font
        ><br /><br />

        Its a cartoon strip generator, allowing you to make cartoon strips with
        all your favourite characters from Digitiser, like Mr T, Insincere Dave,

        <font face="courier" color="ffff00">2. Digitiser? What's that?</font
        ><br /><br />
        Digitiser was a daily computer game magazine running on Channel 4's
        Teletext service from January 1993 to March 2003. Written by Mr. Biffo
        on his own for most of its existence, it was the funniest thing in print
        for a long period of time. More information on Digitiser can be found at
        these excellent sites:<br />

        <font face="courier" color="ffff00"
          >4. How does this cartoon strip generator work, then?</font
        ><br /><br />
        Choose the characters that you want from the selection boxes, and type
        the text you want them to say in the text boxes. And then press
        'Create'. Its as easy as that.

        <br /><br />
        <font face="courier" color="ffff00"
          >5. There's so many characters to choose - how do I know which is
          which?</font
        ><br /><br />
        The <a href="characters.asp">characters</a> page contains a list of all
        the characters, with their pictures and their names, too. <br /><br />
        <font face="courier" color="ffff00"
          >6. Can I save the cartoons I've made?</font
        ><br /><br />
        Technically, no. Although if you save the address of your cartoon strip,
        you can revisit the strip whenever you like, or send it to someone you
        hate.
        <br /><br />
        <font face="courier" color="ffff00">7. Is that it?</font><br /><br />
        For now, at least. If you've got any other questions of suggestions,
